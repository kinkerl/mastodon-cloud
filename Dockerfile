# Base images can be used as the starting point of your docker application.
# We frequently update base images and make new versions available publicly at Docker Hub(https://hub.docker.com/r/divio/base/tags) and publish the source code at GitHub(https://github.com/divio/ac-base).
# Learn how to manage your applications's base image in our documentation(https://docs.divio.com/en/latest/how-to/manage-base-image/).
